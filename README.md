Kaggle Competition :Tweet Sentiment Extraction - link - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction/overview

This project was based in a Kaggle Competition, the premisse for the competion is to construct a model that can identify if a Tweet is as positive, negative or neutral based in the content of the Tweet.
For that we have 2 Data Sets, one to train our model and another to test our model, the evaluation metri c is the word-level Jaccard score, that is often used in NLP to compare sets of words from different texts, more about in (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index).
